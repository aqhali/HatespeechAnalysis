# Hate Speech Analysis
Sentiment Analysis For Automatic Hate Speech Detection

This project represents my final project for COS 424 at Princeton University.

It uses machine learning and NLP techniques to classify tweets as "hateful."

Training data was acquired from CrowdFlower "Hate speech" dataset, currently found [here](https://www.crowdflower.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/twitter-hate-speech-classifier-DFE-a845520.csv)
